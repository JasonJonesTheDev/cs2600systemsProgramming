# Course Description  
Fundamentals of C programming 
and Unix environment. File management, communications and process control. Regular expressions. Unix system calls, concurrent, and socket programming. Learn how to program the Arduino for real-world usage, such as to control lights, motors and motion detection sensors. This course assumes the use of real hardware components in a live lab environment (not software-simulated hardware).   

# Course Objectives  
Upon the completion of this course, the student shall acquire the following knowledge and skills:
* Introduction to the basic concepts of programming in C and its use for problem solving.
* Appreciate the various utilities used for file management, process control, communication and program development
* Master the various UNIX shells and scripting in the bash shell
* Understand the basics of concurrent programming and socket programming
* Program Arduino to control lights, motors, and other devices.
* Understand Arduino's architecture, including inputs and connectors for add-on devices.
* Add third-party components such as LCDs, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS trackers to extend Arduino's functionality.
* Understand the various options in programming languages, from C to drag-and-drop languages.
* Test, debug, and deploy the Arduino to solve real world problems.
* Arduino ESP32 kit
